// async await >> promise chains >> callback hell 

// synchronous -: The code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
//  Each instruction waits fotr the previous instruction to complete its execution.

//  eg
// console.log("one");
// console.log("two");
// console.log("three");


// asynchronous -: due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
// asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
